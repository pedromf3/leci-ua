    <h4>Summer</h4>
    <h6>Allegro non molto</h6>
    <p>
    Under a hard season, <strong>fired up by the sun </strong>  <br />
    Languishes man, languishes the flock and burns the pine
    We hear the cuckoo's voice; <br />
    then <u>sweet songs</u> of the turtledove and finch are heard. <br />
    Soft breezes stir the air, but threatening
    the North Wind<sup>1</sup> sweeps them suddenly aside.  <br />
    The shepherd trembles,
    fearing <del>violent</del> storms and his fate.    

    </p>

    <h6>Adagio e piano â€“ Presto e forte </h6>
    <p>The <em>fear of lightning</em> and <i>fierce thunder</i> <br />
    Robs his tired limbs of rest<sub>2</sub> <br />
    As gnats and flies buzz <s>furiously</s> around.
    </p>

    <h6>Presto</h6>
    <p>Alas, <b> his fears were justified </b> <br />
    The <ins>Heavens thunder</ins> and roar and with hail  <br />
    Cut the head off the wheat and damages the grain. <br />
